Build multiple Logistic Regression Models using different optimization techniques (Newton's using Hessian, Stochastic Gradient, and steepest ascent). 
Test and compare results using different regularization techniques (L1, L2, both, or neither). 
Perform statistical testing to compare model results 
Tune hyperparams, like the cost and learning rate. 
Compare to sklearn model
